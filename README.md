This repository contains my deep learning projects for Udacity's [Deep Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) Nanodegree program. 

Here, you will find projects related to training Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to write new TV scripts, tuning Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate new flower varieties, and deploying a sentiment analysis model in PyTorch using Amazon Web Services (AWS) SageMaker cloud computing capabilities.
